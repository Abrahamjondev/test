                Also, you can directly use your UPI ID to make the payment. We
                also provide EMI options if you think you can not afford a
                complete amount at once. Other than that, you can directly make
                your payment through your bank details and even if you are not
                sure or you are in doubt then you can choose the Cash option
                where you can pay the amount in cash to our partner who will be
                delivering your cloth at your doorstep.
